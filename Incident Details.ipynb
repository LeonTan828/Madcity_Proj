Victim thought he heard a stone strike his vehicle, then discovered that his vehicle had a bullet hole to the rear driver’s side door.  No injuries to anyone in the victim vehicle.  Suspect vehicle described as a white 4dr.  Victim appears to be a random target at this time.  Investigation continuing.\n",

      "An intoxicated 25-year old man was arrested for impersonating a police officer and possessing a switchblade after he tried to shakedown a bicyclist in the 300 block of W. Wilson St. last week. The victim said he was legally biking on a neighborhood sidewalk when the suspect stopped him. The drunken man said he was acting as a law enforcement officer and demanded a $200 fine be paid to him immediately. He told the cyclist he had broken a city ordinance by biking on the sidewalk; it is a violation to do so in a business district, but not in a residential area, and the cyclist knew that he was in the right. He called for police, and the suspect was found asleep in some bushes near the crime scene. \n",

      "A roomful of diners at the Bonfyre American Grille, 2601 W. Beltline Highway, had meals temporarily interrupted as a hammer-wielding shirtless criminal dashed past their tables. Moments earlier the man had broken a dining table inside nearby Silver Mine Subs after jumping on top of it. He was chasing after another man, and the pursuit included four to five laps around a restaurant island. Diners said the shirtless man's trousers were seriously sagging and his upper buttocks area was nearly exposed. The man being chased took off down a hallway and locked himself in a conference room. The shirtless man grabbed a booster seat, for a child diner, and banged on conference room glass before making his exit through the Bonfyre's main dining room. The sub shop, the conference room, and the restaurant are all in the same building. Witnesses saw the man with the hammer jump into the passenger seat of an awaiting car. Prior to disrupting evening meals, the men had been involved in a street fight, according to several people who had called 911.  The witnesses reported seeing two men punching and kicking another man, and that one of the assailants gave chase after the downed man got up and started running. They were last seen going into Silver Mine Subs. Investigating officers - there were several of them - found a gray t-shirt, a black t-shirt, and 4 dreadlocks on the sidewalk in the 2800 block of Todd Dr. This is believed to be where witnesses spotted the first part of the mealtime altercation. Officers found the man who had been chased walking in the area. He provided a fake name, and claimed to not know why he was being pursued. He ended up being arrested for obstructing and on a felony theft warrant. Officers also stopped the car the shirtless man had gotten into. The driver said he does not really know the subject well, but was going to give him a ride. He said he kicked the man out of his car when he saw he was armed with a hammer. The shirtless man was not located, but was undoubtedly the subject of several dining room conversations.  \n",

Seconds later, the witness says many screaming people fled the dance floor and the area of the restroom. Investigators found a possible bullet hole inside the men's restroom. It appears the round exited inside a women's bathroom before lodging in the ceiling. Bouncers found a man bleeding from the face who said he had been pistol whipped, but another witness thought he had been struck with a bottle. The victim did not stick around.

He drew a 41\" sword from its scabbard and pointed it at the other boy, just as the victim pulled the ball out from beneath the bush. The frightened victim said the tip of the sword was at his neck, and he backed away, across the lawn. He said the suspect was threatening him and he feared he would be killed.

Minutes earlier, the suspect had refused to show identification, and began yelling and swearing at the bartender after being asked to do so. He threatened the victim with bodily harm while swinging his banjo. The musical instrument struck the bartender’s leg, but he was not injured. However, by this point, he had had enough, so he grabbed the disorderly man by the arm and escorted him outside. The suspect next grabbed the handle of a hatchet and pulled it from his backpack. The bartender fled back inside the tavern and locked the door while calling 911. Police located the suspect nearby, walking with his dog, his banjo and pack slung over his back. He said he had only been in Madison but a few days, and produced a New York driver’s license. When asked if he wished to talk about what happened, he said not without a lawyer as “I’ve been through this before.” He went to jail; his dog to the Dane County Humane Society.

This matter quickly got out of control as one LPO attempted to communicate with Gevonna Marie Green.  She allegedly threw the merchandise she had stolen at the store official, and proceeded to spray him in the face with mace or a like substance.  The LPO was momentarily disabled, with Green and three other associates (Patterson, Jefferson, and Richmond) fleeing that location and ending up a considerable distance away near the 2100 block of Zeier Road.  Green was being physically detained until police arrived, and during that time Green was said to have bitten a different LPO who attempted to render assistance.  Officers immediately took Green into custody.  The lead officer investigating the matter described “Blood resulting from the biting episode involving Green”.\n",

The public should take note of the repercussions of both bodily injury and additional charges beyond that of the initial complaint, when ideas outside that of complete compliance are contemplated.  It is vitally important to use resolve when dealing with officials, as situations described above will not improve if one makes poor decisions based on irrational conclusions.\n",

      "It was a rude awakening for a 27-year old Madison man Monday morning. In the past he had lost sleep because of loud rock music coming from a neighboring Fordem Ave. apartment, but this was downright scary. While making breakfast, he heard a loud thumping coming from his bedroom. He went to see what the racket was about. This time is was not the rhythmic thumping of stereo speakers, but the polished tip of a sword or dagger piercing the drywall leaving white powder on the carpet below. He retreated to his living room and called for police. Several officers responded, and found two perforations in the wall, and a bulge indicating a third break through attempt. The victim's 21-year old neighbor was contacted. He admitted he got a little carried away while working on a video project where he was in character and wielding a sword. Officers discovered it has a 27\" razor sharp blade. The owner said it is a reproduction of a Japanese \"katana\" sword, once carried by samurai warriors in ancient times. The \"katana\" and a dagger with a 7 1/2 inch blade were taken to the MPD's property room while the suspect went to jail.\n",

      "It was nearing bar time, and a 22-year old downtown resident was in his home, with friends, trying to watch TV. His residence is next to the Red Shed tavern and very near Wando's Bar and Grill. At that time of the morning, patrons begin spilling out onto the sidewalk, and it can be rather noisy. Not the type of atmosphere which makes for good TV watching, particularly on a warm night with windows open.  The 22-year old yelled out for people to quiet down. One reveler did not take kindly to the order, and yelled back about something about grabbing a rock and throwing it threw the window. This ignited an exchange of words that elevated to the point where the 22-year old grabbed his bow and arrow and headed out to the street to confront the other man. This was disturbing to some of the bar time crowd, and two passersby contacted a nearby officer, voicing concern over the situation. The officer upholstered his service weapon and ordered the 22-year old to drop the bow and arrow. The suspect was cooperative and compliant, and said he was just protecting his property. He also said the other man had made anti-Semitic remarks which offended him because he is Jewish. However, when asked how he would feel if he saw someone – armed with a bow and arrow – confronting another person on a crowded downtown street, he responded, \" I would think I was a dangerous person.\" He was cited for disorderly conduct.\n",

      "The Madison Police Department is investigating two weapons violations that are likely related. A husband and wife, who live in the 1300 block of Woodvale Drive, called the MPD Tuesday morning after discovering a bullet hole in their home. The round came into the house leaving bits of drywall lying in a computer room. Officers recovered a .22-caliber round inside the home and .22-caliber casing near a curb of the street. A 35-year old woman, who had parked her car on Woodvale Dr., just north of Academy Dr., also contacted the MPD Tuesday morning after discovering a bullet hole in the fender of her Toyota. Police canvassed the neighborhood, and another woman thought she heard two \"pings\" around 3:00 or 3:30 a.m. Tuesday morning. This crimes appear to be random.\n",

      "A Woodvale Drive homeowner contacted the Madison Police Department (MPD) on October 19th after finding a bullet hole in a window of a room he uses for storage. He last remembered seeing the window undamaged a couple of weeks prior to the 19th. The MPD took a similar bullet hole report from a different Woodvale Drive resident on October 5th (see Incident Report #2010-286534). It is possible the criminal damage to property cases are connected and occurred at nearly the same time.\n",

Thanks to help from witnesses officers were able to locate the suspect, Mr. Hyman Huff, inside his nearby apartment. Mr. Huff was intoxicated, and explained that he had pursued someone - he thought to have been a friend - out of his apartment. Mr. Huff says the man he chased had just punched him several times in the face after he refused to let the man move in with him. He said the man currently resides at the men's shelter. Mr. Huff remembers getting into a heated argument inside his apartment, and running down the hall, but he could not recall going outside. Two knives – one with a 7-½ inch blade, the other with a 9-inch blade – were taken from the residence.\n",

      "On Sunday night, around 11:30 p.m., Madison Police pulled over Ford Explorer in the 6700 block of Schroeder Road after it was observed traveling without its headlights on. The driver pulled over, and a passenger (suspect Riccardo Simms) fled from the SUV. He ran through several backyards, and over a fence. Officers set up a perimeter and were able to take him into custody. The driver (Carlos Wilson) was also arrested. Found inside a canvas tent bag on the backseat of the Explorer was a loaded Chinese made Norinco SKS rifle with collapsible stock, a pistol grip, and pop-up sights. The driver was also found to be in possession of cocaine.\n",

      "On Tuesday night, shortly after 8:00 p.m., a Madison mother called for police after a car driving in front of her in the 450 block of Milwaukee Street stopped suddenly and a fight broke out. The woman had a young daughter with her at the time of the melee. She watched as five men, one of whom was armed with a metal stick, jumped out of a silver Chevrolet Cavalier. They migrated toward her minivan, and she heard a couple of loud whacks. Another witness said he saw the group go after a man who had been walking down the sidewalk. This person was never located. The mother said following the fight the group jumped back in the Cavalier and sped off. The other witness said the man, who had been on the sidewalk, left on foot and did not appear to be injured. The mother got out and found two pencil-sized holes in her passenger-side door. Officers responding to the area located the Cavalier, and pulled it over. Inside was a 16-inch black metal pipe with a rubber handle on one end, a spike the other. The man who wielded it was arrested on weapons charges. Others in the car were cited and released. Investigators believe this case is likely gang related.\n",

      "Early Sunday morning, at 3:24 a.m., Madison police were sent to the 6700 block of Schroeder Road following a disturbance. Witnesses indicated there had been a party in an apartment, and that the two suspects had gotten into a argument after encountering one another outside. Name-calling escalated to the point where Marcus Harrison, age 32, Madison went into a residence and reportedly retrieved several butcher type knives. He then chased the other suspect - Robert Coney, age 37, Madison - around the parking. Coney is accused of getting into a Jeep Grand Cherokee and trying to run Harrison over with the SUV.\n",
